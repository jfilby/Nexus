# Nexus Web Framework

## Introduction

Nexus provides a high-level web framework for [Nim](https://nim-lang.org),
with batteries included. The goal is to create a similar framework for Nim as
Django is for Python or Rails is for Ruby. You can create web apps,
web-services and console applications.

The Nexus ORM allows your to define models, currently in YAML. The command-line
utility (nexus) generates:
- SQL DDL to create tables and indexes.
- Nim types and procs to create, filter, update and delete records.

See the [documentation](https://jfilby.github.io/nexus) to learn about Nexus,
and how to use it to write web-apps and web-services.

Nexus users.


## Nexus v2

The next version of Nexus (v2) is being designed. This is mostly an upgrade for
the ORM to provide more flexible query and DML capabilities.
